# programming_basics

Learning materials for everyone to learn basic concepts of programming.

## Easy
* triangle
* nth_triangle_number (iteration & recursion)
* factorial (iteration & recursion)
* power (iteration & recursion)
* quadratic_function (calculating delta)
* primitive_sort (iteration & recursion)
* bubble_sort
* drawings
* multiplication_table
* ujasia (bruteforce)

## Intermediate
* pesel (multiple files, classes)
* is_prime
* prime_strings
* invert_bin_tree
* neon

## Advanced
* calc

## Warning
If you get confused with me using:  
`scanf("%i %i", &a, &b);`  
`printf("%i %i\n", a, b);`  

It is the same as:  
`cin >> a >> b;`  
`cout << a << " " << b << endl;`  

I use `scanf` and `printf`. I will try to stop using them but this is a habit.  
They work the same. You can use them interchangeably.

## Usage (Linux)
* Creating new solution: `./create-solution.sh <solution_name>`
* Compiling the source code: `make`
* Compiling and running the executable: `make run`
* Cleaning the working directory: `make clean`
